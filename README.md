## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this proyect I reinforce my skills on css and html. However, I tried to use javascript in order to import json file, but I gave up. So, I only coppied table elements from json file. I hope in the near future I'll be able to work with Fetch, javascript and PHP.



### Continued development

I need to improve in Javascript, as well as Fetch API, PHP and I hope in neae future React.
